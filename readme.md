# Icebreaker (20 minutes, til 9:30) (James)

 Find a partner. Spend 5 minutes sketching your partner. On the left, draw three things
 he or she likes, and on the right, three things he or she dislikes.

 Switch!

 For the remaining 10 minutes, we'll go around the room and share!

 Here's a wireframe of Adrian, a WDI Instructor, as an example...

# What is an immersive course? (10 minutes, til 9:40) (Nayana)

Spend two minutes discussing and writing down some answers to the following question: **What does it mean to be in an "immersive" environment?**

**There's no winning or losing.**
- This is a non-competitive environment.
- You get out what you put in.
- Everyone enters and leaves at different levels. Try to compare you with you only.
- Use your classmates' work as inspiration to improve your own!

**Cooperation.**
- You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding together for the next 12 weeks.

**You may be re-learning how to learn.**
- The last time you spent 9 hours a day learning something new was in high school.

**You will be uncomfortable. Regularly.**
- Be empathetic.
- You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.

**Balance.**
- This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
- Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.

**We will not give up on you.**
- Even when you might have given up on yourself!
- None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're nerds, about web development, education, and you.

**Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience.**
- In industry.
- At GA.
- We rely on your feedback. At the same time, we ultimately have to trust in our own experience and expertise first.

**Ultimately, we ask you to trust us and each other.**
- Trust that we have each other's best interests at heart.
- But we expect to have to work to earn that trust.

**Embrace failure.**

**YOLO.**
- Because it's 2016.

> None of the above mentions anything about code.

# Growth Mindset (10 minutes, til 9:50) (Nayana)

[Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_oqghnxBmY_) - [Dr. Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck)

- This may be the most mentally challenging thing you've ever done -- the first time you've been bad at something in a long time.
- You will fail and struggle at times, but that's important. We don't succeed despite challenges -- we succeed because of challenges. [The Learning Myth: Why I'll Never Tell My Son He's Smart](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/95208400815/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes). Take 2 minutes to skim through this article.
  - Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
  - We anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, that's when it is time to really challenge yourself and buckle down. Don't quit! Embrace the fact that the challenge will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.
- The Emotional Cycle of Change
  ![Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)

  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about knowing when to climb from the bottom of the cycle and being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."
  - The growth mindset here is understanding that even when something doesn't work, it will still make you a better coder!
  - We want this to be challenging for you because:
    - Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
    - You can't BS your way through code.
    - The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
    - Google is your best friend
- So many students throughout my time here say, "I don't know how to do that." or some variation of that. Many of you will say it. Just add "...yet" to it.

# What is asking for help? (10 minutes, til 10:00) (James)

- This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not students will be successful in this class.
- Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
- Most importantly, **knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers** is one of the biggest skills you can gain from this class that will be applicable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

**Turn & Talk**: Everyone should take 30 seconds to think of a time when they've asked someone for help. It doesn't have to be tech-related. Then take 30 seconds to turn and share with your tablemates about those times. What were the outcomes?

<!-- ALB: turn into a postit note exercise? -->

We have all asked for help. There's no shame in it. Feeling afraid to ask for help will be the biggest detriment in this class.
- What makes asking for help effective?
  - Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
  - We'll ask you for help when:
      - The question you're asking isn't constructive
      - It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer:
        - First, try it yourself
        - Then, Google it
        - Then, ask your neighbor
        - Finally, ask an instructor

### How the Class is Built

GA's global team (including many of the instructors here) has built a baseline
curriculum, which includes topics to cover, and a suggested order. As a local
campus, we have built on and modified this curriculum based on own experiences
as instructors, and the unique features of the DC job market. Each lesson is
designed by the instructor that's delivering it.

We also iterate on this curriculum constantly, so technologies,  concepts, etc,
change with each cohort.

### Course Content

Exercise: Ask students to list technologies / languages that they think are
involved in web development. Examples: HTML, Ruby, Databases, etc.

Map out the technologies and how they relate to each other. Lead a discussion
on which technologies we'll cover, why we chose those, and why we can't cover
everything.

Technologies we cover:

- HTML
- CSS / SASS
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
- MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
- Rails
- Node.js / Express
- Angular.js
- React.js

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web
development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you
to learn and work in any web development technologies.

### Course Sequence

This course has been pretty well-planned for all 12 weeks, but this is subject
to change.

The course is organized by units of roughly 1 week each. Every 3 weeks, we'll
complete a project (~3-5 days each).

Units/Projects:

- Intro to the Web (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Javascript
- Project 1 - Build an application using HTML / CSS / JS
- Object Oriented Javascript
- Ruby
- Full-stack MVC w/ Rails
- Project 2 - Build a full-stack, data driven app w/ Rails
- Angular and APIs
- Advanced Front-end (using API's on clientside)
- Project 3 - Build a backend API and Front-end that consumes it
- Express and the MEAN stack
- React and Other Libraries
- Project 4 - Portfolio project

- There will be no scheduled lessons, except for a few optional mini-lessons.
- There will be no evening office hours, since instructors will be widely available during the day.
- In most cases, the Outcomes schedule will also remain the same during project weeks

### Squads and Rotations

Each student will be part of a squad lead by one
instructor. Your squad instructor will be the primary (but not the only)
instructor providing you with feedback on homework, labs, quizzes, etc.

Though you'll stay together with your squad throughout the whole course, there
will likely be at least one point in the course where instructors will rotate
and lead a new squad.

### Instructor Communication

- Additional Instructor Support is available during Evening Office Hours from
6:00 - 8:00PM on Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday Nights. WDI instructors from other cohorts will be included in the Office Hours schedule.
- Instructors who are not scheduled for Evening Office Hours **may not**
respond to code questions via Slack or in person, even if we're in the office.
  - **Question**: Why would we do this?
  - **Answer**: Work/Life Balance.
- Feel free to send any messages to us and we'll reach out to you the next day.

# [Graduation Requirements](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi13/blob/master/graduation-requirements.md) (10 minutes, til 10:40) (Andy)

### [Attendance](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi13/blob/master/attendance.md)

# BREAK (10 minutes, til 10:50)

# LEGOHUMAN EXTREME TEAM CHALLENGE (20 minutes, til 11:10) (Nayana)

We're going to do a quick team-building icebreaker exercise that emphasizes specific and clear communication. Communicating clearly and specifically about projects is an important skill for developers, since we typically work in teams. Even if you are a freelance developer, you still have to communicate with the client. Clear communication will convey your professionalism, save you time, and it also minimizes headaches around unclear client expectations.

For this exercise, we'll be working in groups of four or five to recreate a LEGOHUMAN. The LEGOHUMAN is located next to the fridge outside the classroom. One group member at a time can go out for a 10-second interval to take a look at the structure. Cell phones must remain in the classroom. Each person must make one trip before a second or third trip can be made by another person.

The instructors will declare a winner based on the most convincing replica.
